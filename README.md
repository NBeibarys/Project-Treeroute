# treeroute

treeroute is a hackathon-winning multimodal walking route planner for allergy-sensitive New Yorkers.

It helps people choose safer walking routes by combining:

- NYC street tree census data
- live pollen conditions
- live weather and wind
- Google Maps routing
- Gemini-generated grounded explanations

Instead of showing only the fastest path, treeroute ranks 2-3 walking routes by likely pollen exposure so users can walk safer, not just faster.

Built for the NYC Build With AI Hackathon.

## Why It Stands Out

- Real public-interest use case: safer outdoor navigation for allergy-sensitive residents.
- Multimodal experience: voice in, visual map output, voice summary out.
- Strong AI usage: Gemini is used for voice parsing and grounded route explanation synthesis.
- Civic + live data blend: NYC Tree Census plus Google Routes, Pollen, and Weather APIs.
- End-to-end demo flow: landing page, registration, route planner, map, scoring, and explanation output.

## Core Experience

The product flow is:

`/ -> /register -> /planner`

1. A user enters a starting point and destination by typing or voice.
2. The route draft is saved locally.
3. The user registers once with allergy sensitivity and tree-trigger preferences.
4. The planner loads the saved route and analyzes alternative walking paths.
5. treeroute ranks the routes by expected pollen exposure and explains the recommendation.

## Multimodal UX

| Modality | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Speak | Web Speech API mic button for route input |
| Hear | `speechSynthesis` reads the best route recommendation aloud |
| See | Google Maps route overlay, markers, and hotspot visualization |

Voice input is parsed through the FastAPI `/voice-parse` endpoint, which uses Gemini with a regex fallback.

## What The App Does

- Collects route intent on a branded landing page
- Requires a lightweight allergy profile before route analysis
- Supports specific tree-trigger selection or general tree avoidance
- Generates 2-3 walking route alternatives
- Scores routes using tree density, species overlap, pollen, wind, humidity, and sensitivity
- Displays route cards, exposure scores, and map hotspots
- Produces grounded natural-language explanations for why one route is safer

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React + TypeScript
- Python + FastAPI backend
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Google Routes API
- Google Pollen API
- Google Weather API
- Google GenAI SDK with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- NYC 2015 Street Tree Census
- Vitest
- Docker + Cloud Run deployment path

    I --> J[Gemini 2.5 Flash]

    J --> K[Map View]
    J --> L[Route Cards]
    J --> M[Voice Summary]
```

The app now runs as a split architecture:

- `Next.js` serves the React frontend
- `FastAPI` serves the runtime backend in `backend/app`

The browser calls FastAPI directly using `NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL`.

Route analysis follows this path:

1. The frontend submits a request to FastAPI.
2. FastAPI resolves route geometry, weather, and pollen signals.
3. The scoring layer ranks candidate routes against the NYC tree grid.
4. Gemini turns the grounded result into readable explanations.

## Scoring Model

Route exposure is computed by:

1. Decoding each route polyline
2. Sampling points along the path
3. Looking up each sampled point in the tree-grid cells
4. Measuring canopy burden and species overlap with the user's profile
5. Adjusting the result with pollen, wind, humidity, route duration, and user sensitivity
6. Ranking routes from lowest to highest exposure

This means a slightly longer walk can rank higher if it avoids denser or more trigger-heavy canopy pockets.

## Demo Scenario

Try the app with:

- From: `Washington Square Park, New York, NY`
- To: `Lincoln Center, New York, NY`
- Triggers: `oak`, `birch`, `maple`
- Sensitivity: `medium` or `high`

Or say:

`from Washington Square Park to Lincoln Center`

This scenario is tuned to show a visible tradeoff between route speed and allergy exposure.

## Local Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install backend dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root, or copy `.env.example`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_POLLEN_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

5. Start the Next.js app in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run check:fastapi
```

The script hits FastAPI directly and fails if `/health`, `/voice-parse`, or `/route-analysis` is not working.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run dev:backend
npm run build
npm run check:types
npm run test
npm run verify
npm run check:fastapi
npm run build-tree-grid -- ./StreetTreeCensus.csv ./data/tree-grid.generated.json
npm run capture:readme-demo
npm run build:readme-demo-gif
```

## Data

The repository includes a demo tree grid in `data/tree-grid.sample.json`.

That sample is based on the NYC 2015 Street Tree Census and is used to score route exposure by neighborhood canopy burden and top tree species.

## Deployment

The app is configured for standalone Next.js output and includes a `Dockerfile` suitable for Cloud Run.

Example:

```bash
gcloud run deploy treeroute \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...,GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...
```
